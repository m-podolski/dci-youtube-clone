# [DCI Assignment] Youtube Clone

Demo of a youtube-like user interface. The objective was to recreate the main view of the Youtube interface with CSS and (optionally) JS. So this is an exercise in JavaScript in general, in responsive design and the exact reproduction of a given spec into live code. It also served as an opportunity to checkout Snowpack for development and Stylus as an alternative preprocessor to SASS.
